# April 11 2022: Headed to Florence!
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

After a fun and busy week of packing, visiting my parents in Portland, and 
spending time with my lovely Lincoln house housemates, I set off to LAX to 
start my trip on Monday, April 11th!

or Rupesh while I've been away):

# April 12 2022: First night in Florence
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I started off my first evening in Florence with a dream meal of prosciutto with
burrata, papardelle with white boar ragu and chianti. This was when I realized 
that every meal was just going to be on a whole other level for the rest of the 
week.

# April 13 2022: Florence sight-seeing
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I started my exploring at the Boboli Gardens, a large garden established by the
Medici family behind the Pitti Palace in southern Florence. Some of the things
I saw on the walk were: marble statues and fountains, the Lemon House 
(a huge building full of potted citrus trees), and the palace.

Lunch included the best coffee I've ever had and the best sandwich I've ever 
had (focaccia, proscuitto, greens, and maybe marscapone?):

I spent the afternoon crossing the river and exploring the other half of the 
city. I stopped at the Mercato Centrale (a large indoor market with produce,
meats, cheeses, olive oils, lunch), the Cathedral of Santa Maria del Fiore, 
Palazzo Vecchio, and Ponte Vecchio.

In the Salone dei Cinquecento (hall of the five hundred) at Palazzo Vecchio,
there was this drawing of the hall full to capacity that made it so much cooler
to see the room and think about how it would've actually been used at the time.

More amazing food - chocolate and hazelnut gelato, pici with bolognese:

Some random things I learned today:

- 75Â°Â and sunny is socially considered pants and puffy jacket weather in 
  Florence. Shorts, I was quickly informed, were a "brave" choice in such 
  conditions
- Asserting yourself as a pedestrian at a crosswalk will only get you yelled at
  with a lot of Italian hand-waving. You will not get to cross the street
- Chinese dumplings are called raviolis here

# April 14 2022: Pisa + Riomaggiore
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I woke up early today and took the trip to Pisa as a first stop before
continuing to Cinque Terre. Obligatory leaning tower picture + the two other
beautiful structures right next to the tower that I never knew about:

Stopped for a prosciutto, brie, pear, and honey sandwich before continuing on:

Next, I took the train up the coast to Riomaggiore, the southernmost of the
five towns in Cinque Terre. First glimpse of the sea from the train after a 
very long tunnel:

Train station - right on the water!

My first half-hour in Riomaggiore was spent going up many flights of stairs:

But the view at the top was amazing!

# April 15 2022: Hiking through Cinque Terre
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Today I did a combination of hiking and train rides through Cinque Terre. 
Starting in Riomaggiore, I took the Beccara trail to the second town up the 
coast, Manarola. This trail consisted of many stairs alongside beautiful
vineyards and seaside cliffs.


View from the top:

After stopping for lunch (spaghetti with clams!) and exploring Manarola, I took 
the train on to Corniglia. I think this was my favorite of the towns, perched
up higher on a seaside hill and composed of narrow alleys filled with cafes
and shops (and a very cute and amazingly calm cat).

From here, I did the hike to Vernazza, which was pretty challenging for me with
my pack but also had the most amazing views on stretches of trail hanging right
over the water.

After a celebratory focaccia in Vernazza, I continued on to Levanto for the
night (having to bypass the last of the five towns, Monterosso al Mare due
to time).

Looking back, this is one of the most memorable parts of my trip so far!
The day was full with some of the most breathtaking ocean views I've ever seen 
and it was fascinating to see the towns and communities that exist in such a 
unique area. Though the towns are fairly overrun with tourists now, I am 
thankful that they have been preserved to the extent that they are and that I 
had a chance to see them.

# April 16 2022: Exploring Camogli
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

My next stop along the coast was a town called Camogli, on recommendation from
a family friend who's family is from the area! I had a wonderful day walking
around the town, relaxing on the beach, and eating delicious food. I am so 
happy I had the chance to explore this town, it seems like a really special 
place :)

Mixed seafood risotto for lunch with a very cute espresso:

remembered to take a picture):
