# April 11 2022: Headed to Florence!
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

After a fun and busy week of packing, visiting my parents in Portland, and 
spending time with my lovely Lincoln house housemates, I set off to LAX to 
start my trip on Monday, April 11th!

# April 12 2022: First night in Florence
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I started off my first evening in Florence with a dream meal of prosciutto with
burrata, papardelle with white boar ragu and chianti. This was when I realized 
that every meal was just going to be on a whole other level for the rest of the 
week.

# April 13 2022: Florence sight-seeing
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I started my exploring at the Boboli Gardens, a large garden established by the
Medici family behind the Pitti Palace in southern Florence. Some of the things
I saw on the walk were: marble statues and fountains, the Lemon House 
(a huge building full of potted citrus trees), and the palace.

Lunch included the best coffee I've ever had and the best sandwich I've ever 
had (focaccia, proscuitto, greens, and maybe marscapone?):

I spent the afternoon crossing the river and exploring the other half of the 
city. I stopped at the Mercato Centrale (a large indoor market with produce,
meats, cheeses, olive oils, lunch), the Cathedral of Santa Maria del Fiore, 
Palazzo Vecchio, and Ponte Vecchio.

In the Salone dei Cinquecento (hall of the five hundred) at Palazzo Vecchio,
there was this drawing of the hall full to capacity that made it so much cooler
to see the room and think about how it would've actually been used at the time.

More amazing food - chocolate and hazelnut gelato, pici with bolognese:

Some random things I learned today:

- 75° and sunny is socially considered pants and puffy jacket weather in 
  Florence. Shorts, I was quickly informed, were a "brave" choice in such 
  conditions
- Asserting yourself as a pedestrian at a crosswalk will only get you yelled at
  with a lot of Italian hand-waving. You will not get to cross the street
- Chinese dumplings are called raviolis here

# April 14 2022: Pisa + Riomaggiore
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I woke up early today and took the trip to Pisa as a first stop before
continuing to Cinque Terre. Obligatory leaning tower picture + the two other
beautiful structures right next to the tower that I never knew about:

Stopped for a prosciutto, brie, pear, and honey sandwich before continuing on:

Next, I took the train up the coast to Riomaggiore, the southernmost of the
five towns in Cinque Terre. First glimpse of the sea from the train after a 
very long tunnel:

My first half-hour in Riomaggiore was spent going up many flights of stairs:

But the view at the top was amazing!

Finished the day with a ham and mushroom pizza, limoncello cake, and sunset
over the water:
