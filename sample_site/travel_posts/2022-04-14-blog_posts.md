# April 14 2022: Pisa + Riomaggiore
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I woke up early today and took the trip to Pisa as a first stop before
continuing to Cinque Terre. Obligatory leaning tower picture + the two other
beautiful structures right next to the tower that I never knew about:

Stopped for a prosciutto, brie, pear, and honey sandwich before continuing on:

Next, I took the train up the coast to Riomaggiore, the southernmost of the
five towns in Cinque Terre. First glimpse of the sea from the train after a 
very long tunnel:

Train station - right on the water!

My first half-hour in Riomaggiore was spent going up many flights of stairs:

But the view at the top was amazing!

Finished the day with a ham and mushroom pizza, limoncello cake, and sunset

# April 15 2022: Hiking through Cinque Terre
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Today I did a combination of hiking and train rides through Cinque Terre. 
Starting in Riomaggiore, I took the Beccara trail to the second town up the 
coast, Manarola. This trail consisted of many stairs alongside beautiful
vineyards and seaside cliffs.

After stopping for lunch (spaghetti with clams!) and exploring Manarola, I took 
the train on to Corniglia. I think this was my favorite of the towns, perched
up higher on a seaside hill and composed of narrow alleys filled with cafes
and shops (and a very cute and amazingly calm cat).

From here, I did the hike to Vernazza, which was pretty challenging for me with
my pack but also had the most amazing views on stretches of trail hanging right
over the water.

After a celebratory focaccia in Vernazza, I continued on to Levanto for the
night (having to bypass the last of the five towns, Monterosso al Mare due
to time).

Looking back, this is one of the most memorable parts of my trip so far!
The day was full with some of the most breathtaking ocean views I've ever seen 
and it was fascinating to see the towns and communities that exist in such a 
unique area. Though the towns are fairly overrun with tourists now, I am 
thankful that they have been preserved to the extent that they are and that I 
had a chance to see them.
