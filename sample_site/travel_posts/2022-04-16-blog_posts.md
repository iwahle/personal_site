# April 16 2022: Exploring Camogli
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

My next stop along the coast was a town called Camogli, on recommendation from
a family friend who's family is from the area! I had a wonderful day walking
around the town, relaxing on the beach, and eating delicious food. I am so 
happy I had the chance to explore this town, it seems like a really special 
place :)

Mixed seafood risotto for lunch with a very cute espresso:

Revello's focaccia and pastries for dinner (the focaccia disappeared before I 
remembered to take a picture):

# April 17 2022: Genoa + Bordighera
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

After my visit to Camogli, I spent the night in Genoa and got to explore for
a couple hours in the morning. I walked around the old town, an area made up
of narrow alleys that get you turned around very easily.

While most of the city was closed on Sunday, I accidentally happened upon a 
huge international food celebration on the waterfront! There were stands with
6-foot diameter paellas, Argentinian barbecues, Thai street food, and so much
more. Next to all of these stands, the American stand was pretty embarrassing ðŸ˜­.

From here I caught the train to Bordighera, close to the Italy-France border. I
enjoyed one last night of Italian food before heading to France the next day!

Afternoon coffee + focaccia, and gnocchi with clams and pesto for dinner:
