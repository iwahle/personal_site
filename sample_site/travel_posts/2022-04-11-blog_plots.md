# April 11 2022: Headed to Florence!
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

After a fun and busy week of packing, visiting my parents in Portland, and 
spending time with my lovely Lincoln house housemates, I set off to LAX to 
start my trip on Monday, April 11th!

or Rupesh while I've been away):

# April 12 2022: First night in Florence
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I started off my first evening in Florence with a dream meal of prosciutto with
burrata, papardelle with white boar ragu and chianti. This was when I realized 
that every meal was just going to be on a whole other level for the rest of the 
week.

# April 13 2022: Florence sight-seeing
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I started my exploring at the Boboli Gardens, a large garden established by the
Medici family behind the Pitti Palace in southern Florence. Some of the things
I saw on the walk were: marble statues and fountains, the Lemon House 
(a huge building full of potted citrus trees), and the palace.

Lunch included the best coffee I've ever had and the best sandwich I've ever 
had (focaccia, proscuitto, greens, and maybe marscapone?):

I spent the afternoon crossing the river and exploring the other half of the 
city. I stopped at the Mercato Centrale (a large indoor market with produce,
meats, cheeses, olive oils, lunch), the Cathedral of Santa Maria del Fiore, 
Palazzo Vecchio, and Ponte Vecchio.

In the Salone dei Cinquecento (hall of the five hundred) at Palazzo Vecchio,
there was this drawing of the hall full to capacity that made it so much cooler
to see the room and think about how it would've actually been used at the time.

More amazing food - chocolate and hazelnut gelato, pici with bolognese:

Some random things I learned today:

- 75° and sunny is socially considered pants and puffy jacket weather in 
  Florence. Shorts, I was quickly informed, were a "brave" choice in such 
  conditions
- Asserting yourself as a pedestrian at a crosswalk will only get you yelled at
  in Italian with a lot of dramatic hand-waving. You will not get to cross the 
  street
- Chinese dumplings are called raviolis here
