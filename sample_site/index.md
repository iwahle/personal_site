# Hello! I'm Iman.
I am a Schmidt software engineer at Caltech, where I write software that 
identifies causally relevant variables from large-scale observational data. 
More broadly, my research interests are in developing computational methods to 
understand the strategies used by the brain to encode information across
neuron populations.

Alongside my research, I am a beginning 
[ceramicist](https://www.etsy.com/shop/CupsNCupboards?ref=simple-shop-header-name&listing_id=1158538255) 
and love to [travel](travel.html). 

If you would like to chat about any of these topics, please reach out!
